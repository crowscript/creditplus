Frontend Challenge - Creditplus job listings

## Description
Use Next.js to create an overview of all jobs, including a type of pagination (load more button or typical approach you can see find in the layout) and 3 filters: department, city and experience level. The page should be statically pre-rendered, doesnâ€™t need to be production ready though: all jobs can be passed from the server to the client at once, no lazy fetching for the jobs necessary - pagination can be handled client-side completely. Preferably use styled components for styling.

To get all jobs follow the contentful api docs: [content-delivery-api](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/) 

## Create Next App
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
